# Summary

For those of you who like to go the minimalist route... 

From the same designer that brought you all the popular Hero Me remixes...

MediaMan introduces the The E3D Minimalist. 

A simple, clean, lightweight, yet strong mount for your favorite E3D hot-end, V6, Volcano, or clone.

Both mounts leave plenty of room and full access to the accessory screw mounts to allow you to add any of the many ABL sensors and or a parts cooling fan and duct. 

The volcano mount is designed to not lose any Z build height. It is raised and reinforced on the X gantry by 9mm to account for the taller hot-end.

Simply choose the mount you want E3D V6 mount or E3D Volcano mount, and the bracket works for both.

Update2 Feb 19th 2019: Updated the V6 and Volcano mounts with 5015 duct mounts to work with flat head M3 screws instead of tapered head M3 screws. The flat head versions have 'v2' in the file name.

Update Feb 19th 2019: Updated the V6 and Volcano mounts to work with flat head M3 screws instead of tapered head M3 screws. The flat head versions have 'v2' in the file name.

Update Feb 10th 2019: Added updated 5015 radial fan duct with tapered tip and air guides to better direct air flow to the tip of the nozzle.

Minimalist 5015 duct v2.stl

Update Feb 9th 2019: Added 5015 radial fan duct. If you have already printed the original base mounts for the V6 or Volcano, you will need to download the new versions for use with the fan duct. 

New parts are:
Minimalist 5015 duct.stl
MMM E3D V6 w-Duct Mount.stl
MMM E3D Volcano w-Duct Mount.stl

The duct mount uses the same layout for right hand options as found on Chito's popular heavy duty V6 mount system. So most any right hand options available for that system can be mounted on the E3D Minimalist!

Update Feb 18th 2019: Added spacer inserts to support the EZABL Mini. Print 2.

Update Feb 1st 2019: Added 'MMM' logo bracket, functionally identical.
 
Update Jan 31st 2019: 
Minimalist EZABL mount added. Marlin firmware offset: X -32, Y 0.
Minimalist BLTouch adjustable mount added. Marlin firmware offset: X -28, Y -6.

Coming Soon -- Part cooling duct option. In the mean time there are many available here on Thingiverse that are fully compatible with the E3D Minimalist.
